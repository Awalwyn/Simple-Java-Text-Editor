# Simple Java Text Editor

**PH NotePad** is a simple and light **text editor** (notepad) written in Java.

- Search tool (to search code easily in the code) + highlighting the code found

- Find/Replace code feature

- Auto completion for Java and C++ keywords (files need to be saved as *.java*/*.cpp*). It can be easily expanded to support pretty much any number of languages. 

- Nice Image Buttons for better UX


If you use the executable file "notepad.jar" and that it does't run, you can type "java -jar /your_notepad_directory/notepad.jar" in your terminal.
